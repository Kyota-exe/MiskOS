# Tonix
A simple UNIX-like x86_64 operating system I'm working on for learning purposes.

## Features
- ext2 filesystem (backed by RAM rather than by disk for now)
- Dynamic linking with [mlibc](https://github.com/managarm/mlibc)
- ELF executable loading (as a userspace process)
- PSF2 font support
- ANSI escape codes support
- Kernel slab allocator

## Work In Progress
- Shell
- DOOM port
- Window manager in userspace for GUI
